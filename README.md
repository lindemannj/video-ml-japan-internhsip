# Video-Based Tomato Ripeness Estimation

This repository contains the final presentation for my research internship at the **Muroran Institute of Technology, Japan**.  

## Project Overview
During my internship, the primary goal was to explore **video-based ripeness estimation of tomato plants** using machine learning techniques. The project focused on analyzing video data to detect and classify tomatoes by their ripeness stages, leveraging methods such as image preprocessing, segmentation, and tracking.

## Objectives
- Develop a workflow to analyze tomato plant videos.
- Estimate the ripeness of tomatoes based on visual cues.
- Experiment with preprocessing techniques to improve model accuracy and robustness.

## Approach
- Applied image preprocessing techniques such as color-space transformation, normalization, and edge detection.
- Used segmentation methods to isolate individual tomatoes in the video frames.
- Implemented tracking to count and monitor tomatoes over time.
- Combined these techniques to estimate ripeness and generate meaningful metrics.

## Results & Presentation
The results of the project, including methodology, experiments, and insights, are summarized in the **final presentation**.
